Biomass Harvest library for LANDIS-II

Prerequisite for Building and Packaging
---------------------------------------

This project requires the LANDIS-II SDK be installed in order to build
and stage the library's assembly into the LANDIS-II directory structure.
The SDK is also required because it includes the NuGet command-line tool
which is used to package the library.

Release 05 or a later release of SDK v6 is needed.


Packaging and Distributing Releases
-----------------------------------

This library is distributed as a NuGet package.  The process for packaging
and distributing a release of this library is described in the developers
wiki.  Detailed instructions are available at:
